<h1>Welcome to Grimdark 13!</h1>

Do not break the atmosphere.

Do not metagame.</strong>

<strong>This is an atmospheric and immersive roleplay server in the dark setting of 40k. Set from the perspective of a Rogue Trader on a newly founded colony on the fringe of space. Outside of imperial borders and direct control, surrounded by aliens and heretics, and amongst the remains of a civilization born in the dark ages of humanity's distant past. You are to aid (or hinder) this expedition and it's attempts to bring order and exploitation, while dealing with factionalism and politics amongst the ever suspicious Inquisition, the zealots of the Ecclesiarchy, and the dogmatic Priests of the Machine Cult.

You have recently arrived or have been contained for a time within the ice world of Beroghast, bastioned within the noble frontier systems of the Eminent Domain. Finding yourselves in the presence of servants sent by Holy Terra herself. Most unaware of the desanctification of the fortress, the rot of chaos festering within the underdark and the horror that has claimed all those who came before them.

“We are raised to believe that The God Emperor watches over us all. And so we are charged to cleanse the Mutant, the Heretic - the Alien. A morte perpetua, domine, libra nos. That thou wouldst bring them only death, that thou shouldst spare none, we beseech thee, destroy them.”

“I once walked the same ground as your idol. I breathed the same air as him. And I tell you this, without lie or artifice. He never wanted to become what you have made him. He did not wish to be your god-thing. He abhorred such ideals. The slavery of your crippled, blind Imperium would sicken him, if he had eyes to see it.”</strong>
